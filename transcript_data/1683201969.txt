Hi there, my name is Emily Black, class of 2016 Business Manager. 
A few things about myself. 
I enjoyed traveling the world and learned about different cultures and different talents. 
When I was in college, I took a year off to study and work in Germany for a year. 
Also, one of my summers, I spent traveling through Asia where I got into holistic lifestyle, including yoga, meditation, and whole-sum food. 
And since that, one of my passions became cooking whole-sum food.
